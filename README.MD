# Tableau Dashboard Project

This project demonstrates a structured, end-to-end workflow for building Tableau dashboards, from gathering business requirements to producing polished, interactive data visualizations.

The approach is broken into four key phases:

---

## Phase 1: Analyze Requirements

1. Gather business requirements  
2. Identify suitable chart types  
3. Sketch initial mockups/wireframes  
4. Define visual style (colors, layout, typography)  

---

## Phase 2: Build the Data Source

1. Connect and import data  
2. Create the data model  
3. Rename fields for clarity  
4. Validate and adjust data types  
5. Explore and understand the dataset  

---

## Phase 3: Build Visualizations

1. Create and test calculated fields  
2. Build individual charts  
3. Apply formatting and styling:
   - Remove unnecessary chart elements  
   - Adjust axes and labels  
   - Establish a consistent color palette  
   - Design informative tooltips  

---

## Phase 4: Build the Dashboard

1. Draft a layout/wireframe  
2. Create container structure  
3. Assemble all charts  
4. Format and refine:
   - Evenly distribute and align elements  
   - Adjust spacing, sizing, and colors  
   - Fit content to view  
   - Add legends as needed  
   - Use padding for visual balance  

5. Add interactivity (filters, actions, parameters)  
6. Add icons and UI enhancements
